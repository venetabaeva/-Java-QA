/*
* public -> The code is accessible for all classes

* default -> The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when one does not specify a modifier.

//Non - Access Modifiers 
/*
* final -> The class cannot be inherited by other classes
* abstract -> The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. 
* final -> Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified
* static -> Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object
* abstract -> Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run();. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
* transient -> Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them
* synchronized -> Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
* volatile -> The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
